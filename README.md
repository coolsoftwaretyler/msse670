## Week 4

In week 4:

1. I had already implemented three services, so I did not add new ones for this week.
2. I already had exceptions implemented in my services, so I did not add any new ones there, but I did add a custom exception to the factory.
3. One of my test files already handled exceptions, so I updated the other two to do so as well.
4. Implemented the Serializable interface in my domain classes.
5. Added an `IService` marker interface and extended it with existing service interfaces.
6. Implemented the decoupled ServiceFactory as instructed
